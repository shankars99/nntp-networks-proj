Shrek is an animated movie based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book. The name Shrek likely comes from the Yiddish word שרעק (pronounced Shreck) or the German word Schreck. Both words mean "fear" or "terror".[2] It was directed by Andrew Adamson and animated by DreamWorks Animation. It was the first movie to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a category introduced in 2001 . It was released on DVD on November 2, 2001. There have also been three sequels (follow-ups) of Shrek, called Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After. There is also a Christmas special, a Halloween special and a spinoff movie all about a minor character in the sequels and specials. It was adapted into a Broadway musical.
